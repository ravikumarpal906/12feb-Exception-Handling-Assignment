    "An exception in Python is an event that occurs during the execution of a program, leading to the disruption of the normal flow of instructions. When an exception occurs, the program stops executing its regular statements and jumps to a special block of code designed to handle the exception. This block of code is known as an exception handler. Exceptions are raised when errors or unexpected conditions are encountered in the program."
